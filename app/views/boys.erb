    <h2>Self-Esteem Booster</h2>
    <h3>Just remember to be you. You don't have to be the guy that plays video games every night. You don't have to be the jock that gets all the girls. You don't have to fit those teenage stereotypes. All you have to remember is that life gets better after high school.</h3>

        <h2>Bullying: What You Can Do!</h2>
        <h3>There is a difference between what's bullying and what's not.
        Bullying is an imbalance of power and occurs day after day. It can be teasing, harrassment, aggression, taunting, and cruelty.</h3>

        <h3 class=you_bullied>What you should do if you are being bullied:</h3>
        <ol class=you>
            <li>Ignore the bully: if you don't acknowledge the bully, they'll probably stop because they think that what they're doing doesn't bother you.</li>
            <li>Speak up: you can use some clever comebacks, but don't use any that could get you in trouble with grown-ups.</li>
            <li>TELL AN ADULT: be sure to tell an adult, or else the bullying will continue.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h3 class=friend_bullied>What you should do if your friend is being bullied:</h3>
        <ol class=friend>
            <li>Talk to your friend: tell your friend that the bully is wrong. Reassure him or her that he or she is great and shouldn't listen to the bully.</li>
            <li>TELL AN ADULT: telling an adult about bullying isn't considered tattling. Tattling is trying to make someone look bad, reporting is helping someone out.</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h3 class=dont>What you shouldn't do in a bullying situation:</h3>
        <ol class=dont_list>
            <li>Don't ignore the bullying</li>
            <li>Don't try to sort out the facts of the situation right away</li>
            <li>Don't force others to say what they saw publicly</li>
            <li>Don't talk to the kids together, talk to them seperately</li>
            <li>Don't force apologies out of anyone</li>
        </ol>
